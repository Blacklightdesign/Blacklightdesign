## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a Frontend Web Developer driven by a lifelong passion for IT.

I initially worked with a <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack for most of my experience, but I moved to the <abbr title="MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS">MERN</abbr> stack a few years ago. My expertise lies in frontend development, though I still tackle backend projects from time to time.

I started exploring computers as a kid, diving into video games, web design, and photography early on. Creating websites made me realize I'd found my calling.

On the back end, I've worked with PHP (pre-Laravel), NodeJS, and CMS systems like Hugo, Joomla, and WordPress.

On the front end, Iâ€™ve used tools like jQuery and Bootstrap in the beginning, but I always preferred crafting solutions with well-structured CSS and vanilla JavaScript. In the meantime building projects using TypeScript and React I find it interesting.

While computers are at the heart of all my interests, I also love the classic nerd hobbies: video games and Science Fiction/Fantasy, but also biking and gardening.

Most importantly, my wife and son are my greatest inspirations.

I was born and raised in Thuringia, and I've been fortunate enough to visit and live in various places. Along the way, Iâ€™ve picked up a lot of inspiration and ideas.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on building a portfolio from my past projects and a few new ideas.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use Salesforce with React.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting JavaScript or CSS challenges.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me [@Blacklight@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Blacklight)

While my portfolio is being finalized, you can take a look at some of my recent projects at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/blacklightdesign).
